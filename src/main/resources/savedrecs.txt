AB Under natural conditions, we prove exponential ergodicity in the L-1-Wasserstein distance of two-type continuous-state branching processes in Levy random environments with immigration. Furthermore, we express precisely the parameters of the exponent. The coupling method and the conditioned branching property play an important role in the approach. Using the tool of superprocesses, ergodicity in total variation distance is also proved.
